# Hello Moveo
hope you enjoy my little project I made for you, the language I used is Typescript

## Technology stack - backend
- node.js
- express
- socket.io
- mongoDB

## Technology stack - frontend
- React
- Redux
- react-router-dom

## If I had more time
- implement a better user expirience in the lobby where when a user joins you can see it on the card
- make the site more personal by ability to add your name and others to see you by that name when you enter into a coding session
- make the code more preformant

Hope you have a good day ðŸ˜€
